<p class="sansserif"> Big Joe had been working as a server for fifty years before branching out on his own to start Big Joe's Barbecue Joint. Big Joe's Barbecue Joint was founded in 2015 in sunny Micanopy, Florida. Since then we have expanded into Jacksonville, Orlando, Miami, and Tampa and have been labeled as the best barbecue joint in the southeastern part of the country. </p>

<h2 style="text-align:center; font-size:45px; background-color: yellow"> Our Promise </h2>
<p class="sansserif"> You may be wondering to yourself how a small town family restaurant has been able to grow and expand so much in such a short amount of time. The simple answer to that is, the people. The people that great you at the door, the people that work diligently to make sure you are getting the quality food you pay for and the people that work diligently to provide a fun environment. Here at Big Joe's we promise to provide a family friendly atmosphere and top-notch service to ensure an enjoyable experience for every member of your family. 
<h2 style="text-align:center; font-size:45px; background-color: blue"> Our History </h2>
<p class="sansserif"> Our family created this business after not being able to find a sauce hot enough to burn our tastebuds off. We love heat and nothing was hot enough for us so we thought, "why not create a hot that is too hot to handle?"</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center; font-size:45px; background-color: red"> Our Location </h2>
<p class="sansserif"> We chose to base our business in Florida becasue it has always been a dream of ours to move somewhere nice and warm. The beaches of Florida were calling our name so we decided to start our business in FLorida. </p>
