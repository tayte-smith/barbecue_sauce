Big Joe's Barbecue Joint was founded in 2015 in sunny Micanopy, Florida. Since then we have expanded into Jacksonville, Orlando, Miami, and Tampa and have been labeled as the best barbecue joint in the southeastern part of the country. </p>

<h2 style="text-align:center; font-size:45px; background-color: blue"> Our History </h2>
<div class="container">
<p class="sansserif"> Our family created this business after not being able to find a sauce hot enough to burn our tastebuds off. We love heat and nothing was hot enough for us so we thought, "why not create a hot that is too hot to handle?"</p>
</div>
<h2 style="text-align:center; font-size:45px; background-color: red"> Our Location </h2>
<div class="container">
<p class="sansserif"> We chose to base our business in Florida becasue it has always been a dream of ours to move somewhere nice and warm. The beaches of Florida were calling our name so we decided to start our business in FLorida. </p>
